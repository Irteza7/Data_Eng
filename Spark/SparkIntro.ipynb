The latency associated with communicating back and forth to the JVM can sometimes cause the code to run slower.\n","An exception to this is the SparkSQL library, which has an execution planning engine that precompiles the queries. Even with this optimization, there are cases where the code may run slower than the native scala version.\n","The general recommendation for PySpark code is to use the \"out of the box\" methods available as much as possible and avoid overly frequent (iterative) calls to Spark methods.
